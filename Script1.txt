Certainly! Here’s an updated script that highlights the technologies used to build MailMentor while retaining the original structure and focus:

Slide 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

Speaker Notes:
“Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I’m excited to share with you a tool that our team, the SpeedReaders, developed during this year’s hackathon: MailMentor.

This solution demonstrates the incredible potential of document intelligence and AI-driven automation and how these technologies can revolutionize the way we process emails and documents, transforming workflows for both financial advisors (FAs) and operations teams.

Let me walk you through what MailMentor does, how it works, the technologies that power it, and the impact it can have on our business.”

Slide 2: The Problem (3 minutes)

Speaker Notes:
“Let’s start by understanding the problem we’re addressing.

Financial advisors and operations teams deal with overwhelming volumes of emails and documents daily—financial statements, agreements, tax forms, client updates, and more.
	•	Currently, much of this work is manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
	•	These delays can lead to missed deadlines, inefficiencies, and sometimes even compliance risks.

The growing need for speed and accuracy in document processing calls for an automated, intelligent solution that reduces manual intervention and frees up time for higher-value tasks.”

Slide 3: The Solution – MailMentor (4 minutes)

Speaker Notes:
“MailMentor was created to solve these challenges by using cutting-edge technologies to automate email and document processing. Here’s how it works:
	1.	Email Scanning: MailMentor monitors a dedicated email inbox for incoming client messages, built with Spring Boot as the foundation.
	2.	Data Storage: The email content and metadata—such as sender, subject, and attachments—are securely stored in a MongoDB database for centralized access.
	3.	Attachment Analysis: Microsoft Document Intelligence performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on attachments, extracting text from PDFs, images, Word documents, and even handwritten notes.
	4.	AI-Powered Insights: OpenAI analyzes the extracted content and email body to provide:
	•	Summaries of the email and its attachments
	•	Recommendations for next steps
	•	Tags for sentiment analysis or categorization
	5.	Front-End Display: The results are displayed in a user-friendly ReactJS application, offering an intuitive interface for financial advisors and operations teams to access actionable insights.

In just two days, we integrated these technologies to build a seamless, automated workflow that reduces manual effort and delivers valuable insights.”

Slide 4: Why Document Intelligence and AI Matter (4 minutes)
